The Nordic Thingy:91 X is a Cellular IoT prototyping platform that's built
around Nordic’s nRF9151 System-in-Package (SiP).

Thingy:91 X supports LTE-M, NB-IoT, GNSS, and DECT NR+ connectivity.

The platform also integrates Nordic’s nRF7002 Companion IC for Wi-Fi
locationing, the nPM1300 Power Management IC (PMIC), which features innovative
system management features and efficient fuel gauging, and the nRF5340
dual-core, multiprotocol SoC.
