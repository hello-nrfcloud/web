The Thingy:91 has been fitted with Exeger's Nordic Thingy Powerfoyle add-on
which is available for the Nordic Thingy:52, Thingy:53, and Thingy:91
prototyping platforms, giving the platforms autonomous charging capabilities.

Exegerâ€™s groundbreaking solar cell technology, Powerfoyle, is a flexible and
resilient photovoltaic cell which converts all forms of light - both artificial
indoor and natural outdoor - into clean, endless energy. To learn more the
innovation and application areas, visit

The Thingy:91 runs the
[`asset_tracker_v2` application](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html)
configured in low-power mode, requires 3.4 mA when sending updates to the cloud
every minute, or 2.3 mA when sending updates to the cloud.
