    title: Getting Started with the Nordic Thingy:91 and Powerfoyle Shield
---

The Nordic Thingy:91 Solar Shield is a plug-and-play prototyping platform.
Powerfoyle solar cell is mounted onto the Thingy to quickly get started
exploring the endless possibilities with solar powered IoT applications and to
develop products with eternal life or even battery-free products.​

The Thingy:91 runs the
[`asset_tracker_v2` application](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html)
configured in low-power mode, requires 3.4 mA when sending updates to the cloud
every minute, or 2.3 mA when sending updates to the cloud.

Powerfoyle is a groundbreaking solar cell technology made by Exeger. Powerfoyle
has a uniquely flexible and customizable design to integrate seamlessly for
sustainable and attractive products. To learn more the innovation and
