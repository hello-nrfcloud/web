SparkFun has teamed up with CircuitDojo to bring you the SparkFun nRF9160 Thing
Plus, featuring the powerful Nordic nRF9160 microcontroller in a
Feather-compatible footprint. This little chip is capable of both CAT M1 LTE and
NB-IoT cellular communication and is designed to work with Zephyr, the go-to
RTOS for embedded development. To make the Thing Plus even easier to use, this
board utilizes our handy Qwiic Connect System which means no soldering or
shields are required to connect it to the rest of your system!
