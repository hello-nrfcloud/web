The Thingy:91 has been fitted with Exeger's Nordic Thingy Powerfoyle add-on
which is available for the Nordic Thingy:52, Thingy:53, and Thingy:91
prototyping platforms, giving the platforms autonomous charging capabilities.

Exegerâ€™s Powerfoyle photovoltaic cells harvest all forms of light and convert it
into electrical energy. This allows the battery life of the device to be
extended indefinitely as long as there is sufficient ambient light available.

The Thingy:91 runs the
[`asset_tracker_v2` application](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html)
configured in low-power mode, requires 3.4 mA when sending updates to the cloud
every minute, or 2.3 mA when sending updates to the cloud.
